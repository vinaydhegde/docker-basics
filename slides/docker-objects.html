<h2>DOCKER OBJECTS</h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li class="fragment"><b>IMAGES:</b><br>
	An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.  
	Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization.
	</li>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
		<li class="fragment">To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax 
		for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it.</li>
		<li class="fragment">Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image.</li>
		<li class="fragment">When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, 
		only those layers which have changed are rebuilt.</li>
		<li class="fragment">This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, 
		when compared to other virtualization technologies</li>
	</ul>			
	<li class="fragment"><b>CONTAINERS:</b><br>
	A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container 
	using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, 
	attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.
	</li>
	<li class="fragment"><b>SERVICES:</b><br>
	Services allow you to scale containers across multiple Docker daemons, 
	which all work together as a swarm with multiple managers and workers.
	</li>
</ul>
