<h2>NETWORKING</h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li class="fragment">Docker implements networking in an application-driven manner and provides various options while maintaining enough abstraction for application developers. 
	</li>
	<li class="fragment">There are two types of networks:
	<ol>
	<li class="fragment"><b>default Docker networks</b></li> 
	<li class="fragment"><b>user-defined networks</b></li>
	</ol>	
	<li class="fragment">By default, you get three different networks on the installation of Docker:
	<ol>
	<li class="fragment"><b>none</b></li>
	<li class="fragment"><b>bridge</b></li>
	<li class="fragment"><b>host</b></li>
	</ol>
	<li class="fragment">The <b>none</b> and <b>host</b> networks are part of the network stack in Docker.</li> 
	<li class="fragment">The <b>bridge network</b> automatically creates a gateway and IP subnet and all containers that belong to this network can talk to each other via IP addressing. This network is not commonly used as it does not scale well and has constraints in terms of network usability and service discovery
	</li>			
	
</ul>
