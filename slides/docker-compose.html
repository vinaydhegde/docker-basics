<h2>DOCKER COMPOSE</h2>
<p>Compose is a tool for defining and running <b>multi-container</b> Docker applications</p>
<p class="fragment"><br>Using Compose is basically a three-step process:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:square">
  <li class="fragment">Define your appâ€™s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere</li>
  <li class="fragment">Define the services that make up your app in <b>docker-compose.yml</b> so they can be run together in an isolated environment.</li>
  <li class="fragment">Run <b><i>docker-compose up</i></b> and Compose starts and runs your entire app.</li>

</ol>
