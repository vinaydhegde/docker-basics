	<li class="fragment"><b>SERVICES:</b><br>
	Services allow you to scale containers across multiple Docker daemons, 
	which all work together as a swarm with multiple managers and workers.
	</li>			
	<li class="fragment"><b>UNION FILE SYSTEM:</b><br>
	Union file systems, or UnionFS, are file systems that operate by creating layers, making them very lightweight and fast. Docker Engine uses UnionFS to provide the building blocks for containers. 
    Docker Engine can use multiple UnionFS variants, including AUFS, btrfs, vfs, and DeviceMapper.
	</li>
	<li class="fragment"><b>CONTAINER FORMAT:</b><br>
	Docker Engine combines the namespaces, control groups, and UnionFS into a wrapper called a container format. 
    The default container format is <b>libcontainer</b>
	</li>
</ul>
