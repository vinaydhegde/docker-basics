<h2>DOCKER ENGINE</h2>
<p><b>Docker Engine is a client-server application with these major components:</b></p>
	<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
		<li class="fragment">A <b>server</b> which is a type of long-running program called a daemon process (the dockerd command).</li>
		<li class="fragment">A <b>REST API</b> which specifies interfaces that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do.</li>
		<li class="fragment">A <b>command line interface (CLI)</b> client (the docker command).</li>
    </ul>
<p class="fragment">The CLI uses the Docker REST API to control or interact with the Docker daemon <br>
through scripting or direct CLI commands. The daemon creates and manages Docker objects, such as <br>
images, containers, networks, and volumes</p>
