<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li><b>The Docker daemon</b></li>
		<p>The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects <br> 
such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.<br><br>
A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.</p>
	<li><b>The Docker client</b></li>
<p>The Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker.<br>
 When you use commands such as <b>docker run</b>, the client sends these commands to dockerd, which carries them out.
	<li><b>Docker registries</b></li>
<p>A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use,<br>
 and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry<p>
</ul>
