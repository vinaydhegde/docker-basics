<h2>DOCKER RUN VS CREATE &amp; START</h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
	<li class="fragment">The docker create command creates a writeable container layer over the specified image and prepares it for running the specified command. The container ID is then printed to STDOUT. This is similar to docker run -d except the container is never started. You can then use the docker start command to start the container at any point.
	</li>
	<li class="fragment">This is useful when you want to set up a container configuration ahead of time so that it is ready to start when you need it. The initial status of the new container is created.
	</li>
	<li class="fragment">docker run = docker create + docker start
	</li>
</ul>
